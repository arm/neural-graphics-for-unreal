# Public v1.0.0 Release Notes

Arm®'s Neural Super Sampling (NSS) Plugins for Unreal® Engine 5.4 and 5.5 provide two different implementations of the NSS technique to support game developers. UE5.4 plugin is built on top of Neural Graphics SDK for Game Engines, UE5.5 plugin uses Unreal® Neural Network Engine to perform inference of the machine learning model.

## Limitations
This is a Vulkan focused delivery so when using other RHI this plugin will not be enabled for both UE5.4 and UE5.5 version. If you enable this plugin when using other RHI, a warning windows will pop out on the screen.

Please note this plugin is designed for desktop development using ML Emulation Layer for Vulkan for both UE5.4 and UE5.5 version. Thus the runtime performance is not indicative of real device performance.

As part of testing the Neural Upscaler it is recommended that you disable the following features in Unreal, because they can interfere with this technique: Lumen, Motion Blur and Depth of Field.

## Contents
This release package contains the following contents:

UE5.4 folder contains:
### Neural Upscaler
- Unreal® Engine plugin providing Neural Upscaling using the `UE::Renderer::Private::ITemporalUpscaler` interface.
